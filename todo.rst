Not necessarily complete list of things to do
=============================================

(mainly so I don't forget, and because issues are kinda heavy, at
least at this point)

- Travis

- Measure w shootout

Medium priorities:

- Custom transformations

- Async support

- ZConfig directive for use of adapter in existing RelStorage apps.

- Run all or nearly all postgres adapter tests from RelStorage.

  This will probably require adding restore support.

Low priorities:

- Restore support
