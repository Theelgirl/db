Newt DB, the amphibious database
================================

- Enjoy the ease of working with your data in Python as ordinary
  objects in memory.
- Data are moved in and out of memory as needed, so databases can be
  as large as needed.
- Index and search your data using Postgresql, from within your
  application and externally.
- Within your application, search results may be returned as
  application objects, or as data, depending on your needs.
- Data are visible and searchable outside your application as JSON.
- Transactional and built on mature technology for reliability.
